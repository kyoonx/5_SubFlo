# What is and Why SubFlo?
*SubFlo* comes from **“subscription” + “flow.”** It’s a web application designed to help users identify and manage forgotten subscriptions. By scanning emails and transaction histories, *SubFlo* detects active subscriptions and displays them in a dashboard, including direct links to unsubscribe from services with ease.

# UI
- **Navbar**: Integrated navigation links to the three main pages—Dashboard (home page), All Emails, and User Profile—allowing users to switch between them quickly and easily.

- **Dashboard**: Displays an overview of all subscription information, including key details and a summary section at the top.

- **All Emails**: Lists all subscription-related emails that are processed to extract subscription data.

- **User Profile**: Shows detailed user information and account settings.
