Assignment 2 - Section 2 — Views (FBV + CBV) for SubFlo

A) Function-Based Views (FBVs)
  - HttpResponse (Manual)
    - `email_message_detail`: Display the email message information by a given message_id (http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/email_message/30d5782b-5a34-4125-bcea-99d83d37a589)
  - render() (Shortcut)
    - `subscription_detail`: Display the subscription information by a given id (http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/11)


B) Class-Based Views (CBVs)
  - Base CBV (inherit from View)
    - `AccountDetail`: Display user profile information by a given id (http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/5)
  - Generic CBV (inherit from Django generic views)
    - `SubscriptionList`: Display all subscriptions in a dashboard (http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/)


When each was useful:
- HttpResponse vs render:
  HttpResponse is quick for simple debugging / proof-of-concept output.
  render() is best for real pages because templates keep logic and HTML cleanly separated.

- Base CBV vs Generic CBV:
  Base CBV is useful when you want custom logic per HTTP method but still prefer class structure.
  Generic CBV is ideal for standard CRUD/list/detail pages because it reduces boilerplate and follows conventions.


==============================================

Assignment 3 - Section 1

For which feature you've implemented get_absolute_url() is useful?
The hyperlink in dashboard that will navigate users to each subscription detail.


Assignment 3 - Section 2

Static file organization choice
- We decided to use "Project Level" since our app needs a few pictures and no separated CSS files (we use TailwindCSS for styling.)


Assignment 3 - Section 6

How are we planning to create an API for our project?
Apart from the internal APIs that perform business logic, the external APIs will be used by other developers to integrate with their applications. One of the main external APIs is `api_all_active_subscriptions`, which returns all subscription details for a particular user. Another external API we are currently providing is `api_verify_user_id`, which allows others to check whether a particular user ID exists in our database. As new features are developed, more external APIs will be created accordingly.

What kind of data are we planning to serve?
At the moment, we are primarily serving information from the `Subscription` model, which includes all relevant details about the services a user is subscribed to, how much they cost, their start date, end date, and other related information.
