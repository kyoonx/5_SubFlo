Assignment 2 - Section 2 — Views (FBV + CBV) for SubFlo

A) Function-Based Views (FBVs)
  - HttpResponse (Manual)
    - `email_message_detail`: Display the email message information by a given message_id (http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/email_message/30d5782b-5a34-4125-bcea-99d83d37a589)
  - render() (Shortcut)
    - `subscription_detail`: Display the subscription information by a given id (http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/11)


B) Class-Based Views (CBVs)
  - Base CBV (inherit from View)
    - `AccountDetail`: Display user profile information by a given id (http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/5)
  - Generic CBV (inherit from Django generic views)
    - `SubscriptionList`: Display all subscriptions in a dashboard (http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/)


When each was useful:
- HttpResponse vs render:
  HttpResponse is quick for simple debugging / proof-of-concept output.
  render() is best for real pages because templates keep logic and HTML cleanly separated.

- Base CBV vs Generic CBV:
  Base CBV is useful when you want custom logic per HTTP method but still prefer class structure.
  Generic CBV is ideal for standard CRUD/list/detail pages because it reduces boilerplate and follows conventions.
