Section 2 — Views (FBV + CBV) for SubFlo

Domain model used: Subscription (subscriptions app)
Purpose: Display a list of subscriptions on the dashboard.

A) Function-Based Views (FBVs)
1) subscriptions_manual_html (HttpResponse Manual)
- Type: FBV
- Purpose: Demonstrates returning raw HTML (no render shortcut). Shows up to 10 subscriptions.

2) subscriptions_render (render() Shortcut)
- Type: FBV
- Purpose: Queries Subscription.objects.all() and renders a template with context.

B) Class-Based Views (CBVs)
3) SubscriptionsBaseCBV (Base CBV inherits View)
- Type: CBV (django.views.View)
- Purpose: Same behavior as render FBV but structured as a class with get().

4) SubscriptionsGenericListView (Generic CBV inherits ListView)
- Type: CBV (Django generic view)
- Purpose: Uses ListView + model = Subscription to list subscriptions with much less code.

When each was useful:
- HttpResponse vs render:
  HttpResponse is quick for simple debugging / proof-of-concept output.
  render() is best for real pages because templates keep logic and HTML cleanly separated.

- Base CBV vs Generic CBV:
  Base CBV is useful when you want custom logic per HTTP method but still prefer class structure.
  Generic CBV is ideal for standard CRUD/list/detail pages because it reduces boilerplate and follows conventions.
