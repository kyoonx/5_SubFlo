# Branching Strategy
- `master`: Represents the main branch of the project. Every commit in this branch is considered ready to deploy.
- Other branches (such as `dashboard`): Represent individual applications or features. New enhancements should be implemented in their corresponding branch.
- After peer review (from team members and the professor), the branches will be merged into `master`.
